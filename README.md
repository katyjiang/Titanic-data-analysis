# Titanic-data-analysis

In this project, I am going to diving into the data of Titanic disaster, using all those data to analyse several questions.

who were the people on the ship?

what deck were the passengers on and how does that relate to their class?

where is passengers come from?

who was alone and who was with family?

what factor help peopel survive ?

Did the deck have an effect on the survival rate?

Did having a family member increase the odds of surviving the crash?
